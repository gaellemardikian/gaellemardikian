## 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Gaelle Mardikian**, a Robotics engineering student at **Polytech Sorbonne, Paris** 🏫🤖  
Passionate about mechatronics, AI, and creative coding projects.

---

### 🚀 Projects I've worked on:

- 🤖 **Living Machine** – A small robot that can recognize a suspect and chase it using servomotors and computer vision.
- ♟️ **Chess Game** – A playable chess game where you can challenge the computer.
- 🦾 **Autonomous Robot** – A robot that detects and retrieves an object and places it in a specific location.

> I’m always curious to learn and build new things — especially at the intersection of software and hardware!
